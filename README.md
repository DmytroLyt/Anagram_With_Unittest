# Anagram_With_Unittest
The Task:

Write tests to the previous task using Unittest All tests should be in tests folder.

Code should be covered by tests over 80 percent. For measuring code coverage use package coverage.

Your tests should also check for other cases, for example, what happens if a number is passed to your function. You should modify your function for atypical behaviors.

Hint. Your test should have two test cases. The first test case should check typical behavior(you can add parametrize for that test case). The second test case should check atypical behavior.
